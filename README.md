👋 Hi, I’m Maureen Osauzo — AI Product Manager, Builder & Strategist

Welcome to my AI Product Management Portfolio, showcasing three end-to-end AI/ML projects that reflect how I think, build, evaluate, and communicate as a PM.

These projects were designed using the same product and technical principles expected at Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google APM, Meta RPM, and top-tier AI companies.

I specialize in:

AI product development

Retrieval systems & search evaluation

RAG pipelines & truthful AI

AI safety & content moderation

Rapid prototyping (Replit)

User experience for AI products

Metrics-driven product decision-making

This portfolio highlights the full lifecycle of AI product management:
problem discovery → scoping → UX → modeling strategy → evaluation → system design → prototyping → roadmap.

⭐ Portfolio Overview
🔍 1. Search Relevance Optimization for Q&A Platforms

Goal: Improve relevance rankings using BM25 vs embeddings, with metric-driven evaluation.

Core Skills:
Relevance scoring, query understanding, ranking evaluation (NDCG, Precision@k), system architecture, latency tradeoffs.

Prototype:
Replit app showing relevance ranking, scores, and latency.

📚 2. RAG Truthfulness + Citation Engine (“Mini Perplexity”)

Goal: Build a small retrieval-augmented answering pipeline with citations and hallucination detection.

Core Skills:
Embeddings, vector search, chunking, top-k retrieval, RAG, factual grounding, hallucination analysis, LLM evaluation.

Prototype:
Replit app: query → retrieved docs → answer → citations → confidence score.

🛡️ 3. Toxicity Detection + Real-Time Safety Thresholding

Goal: Build a real-time classifier with threshold tuning and safety UX flows.

Core Skills:
Model thresholds, false positive/false negative tradeoffs, content policy logic, risk scoring, safety UX, real-time inference.

Prototype:
Replit app: text input → toxicity score → recommended action (allow, warn, block).

🧭 My Product Philosophy

I build AI products that emphasize:

Truthfulness and safety

Fast, relevant retrieval

Trust-building UX

Scalable technical decisions

Execution velocity

Metric-driven iteration

User-first thinking

AI products should be:
useful → reliable → responsible → delightful.

🎯 Why These Projects?

These three projects were intentionally chosen because together they demonstrate the exact PM skillset Perplexity evaluates:

Search relevance

Retrieval pipelines

RAG systems

Summarization with citations

AI safety

Real-time systems

Tradeoff analysis

Metrics and evaluation

UX for AI

Prototyping at speed

This portfolio is my way of showing not just what I can build, but how I think.
